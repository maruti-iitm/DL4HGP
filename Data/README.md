This folder provides the links for simulation and observational data

1. Permeability realizations (a total of 302)
2. Time-lapse ERT data -- Transfer resistance (a total of 302)
3. Train, Val, and Test splits (282/10/10)
4. Observational data (transfer resistance observed in field)
5. Material ID for masking (e.g., river, Hanford, ringold etc)


The datasets are of big size and are available at: DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.7026248
